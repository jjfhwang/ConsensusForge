# ConsensusForge: Streamlining Distributed Consensus Algorithms

ConsensusForge is a Python library designed to simplify the implementation and experimentation with distributed consensus algorithms. It provides a modular framework for building and testing different consensus mechanisms, abstracting away much of the boilerplate code typically associated with distributed systems development. This allows developers and researchers to focus on the core logic of their chosen consensus algorithm, accelerating the prototyping and validation process.

This library addresses the challenge of implementing robust and fault-tolerant distributed systems. Developing consensus algorithms from scratch is a complex undertaking, requiring careful consideration of network conditions, message passing, and potential failure scenarios. ConsensusForge provides a set of reusable components and abstractions that handle these common concerns, significantly reducing the development effort. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing users to easily integrate new algorithms and customize existing ones to meet their specific requirements.

By leveraging ConsensusForge, developers can quickly create and deploy distributed applications that require strong consistency and reliability. The library offers features such as message serialization, network communication, and leader election mechanisms, all built on a foundation of well-tested and documented code. Whether you are building a distributed database, a fault-tolerant queue, or a decentralized application, ConsensusForge provides the building blocks necessary to achieve consensus across a network of nodes.

ConsensusForge is not intended to be a production-ready consensus implementation, but rather a flexible tool for research, education, and rapid prototyping. It encourages experimentation and learning by providing a clear and concise interface for interacting with different consensus algorithms. The modular design makes it easy to isolate and analyze specific components, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of distributed consensus.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is organized into independent modules, allowing for easy customization and extension of individual components, such as the message transport layer or the consensus logic itself. This modularity promotes code reusability and simplifies the integration of new features.
*   **Pluggable Consensus Engines:** Support for multiple consensus algorithms, including Paxos, Raft, and Zab (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast), with a clear API for adding new algorithms. Each consensus engine is implemented as a separate class that adheres to a common interface, making it easy to switch between different algorithms for testing and comparison.
*   **Simulated Network Environment:** A built-in network simulator that allows developers to test their consensus algorithms under various network conditions, such as packet loss, latency, and network partitions. This simulator provides a controlled environment for evaluating the performance and fault tolerance of different algorithms.
*   **Message Serialization and Deserialization:** The library includes a robust message serialization and deserialization mechanism based on Protocol Buffers or similar technologies, ensuring reliable communication between nodes in the distributed system. This serialization layer supports versioning and schema evolution, making it easy to update the message format without breaking compatibility.
*   **Leader Election:** A variety of leader election mechanisms are provided, including implementations based on Paxos and Raft. These mechanisms ensure that a single node is designated as the leader, responsible for coordinating the consensus process.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Extensive logging and monitoring capabilities are built into the library, allowing developers to track the progress of the consensus process and identify potential issues. Metrics such as message latency, throughput, and error rates can be collected and visualized using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the library, providing a flexible and expressive environment for developing distributed systems.
*   **asyncio:** Python's asynchronous I/O library, enabling non-blocking communication and efficient handling of concurrent requests.
*   **Protocol Buffers (or equivalent):** Used for message serialization and deserialization, ensuring reliable and efficient communication between nodes.
*   **Networking Libraries (e.g., gRPC, ZeroMQ):** Provides the underlying network communication infrastructure for exchanging messages between nodes. The choice of library can be configured based on performance and scalability requirements.
*   **pytest:** A testing framework for writing and running unit tests and integration tests.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/ConsensusForge.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd ConsensusForge
3.  Create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv
4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
5.  Install the dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
6.  (Optional) Install development dependencies for testing and linting:
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## Configuration

The configuration of ConsensusForge is primarily managed through environment variables. These variables allow you to customize the behavior of the library without modifying the code directly.

*   `NODE_ID`: A unique identifier for each node in the distributed system. This ID is used to distinguish nodes from each other and is essential for the consensus process.
*   `NODE_ADDRESS`: The network address (IP address and port number) of the node. This address is used by other nodes to communicate with the node.
*   `CONSENSUS_ALGORITHM`: Specifies the consensus algorithm to be used (e.g., "Paxos", "Raft").
*   `NETWORK_SIMULATOR_ENABLED`: A boolean flag indicating whether the network simulator should be enabled. If enabled, the simulator will introduce artificial network conditions, such as packet loss and latency.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level to be used (e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR").

These environment variables can be set in a `.env` file or directly in the shell environment.

## Usage

To use ConsensusForge, you will typically start by creating an instance of a consensus engine, such as the Paxos engine or the Raft engine. You will then configure the engine with the appropriate parameters, such as the node ID, the network address, and the list of other nodes in the system.

Example:



This example demonstrates how to initialize the Paxos engine, propose a value, and retrieve the agreed-upon value. More detailed examples and API documentation can be found in the `docs` directory of the repository.
